# ECON490 Project: Crime Trends and Cannabis Legalization in Vancouver

This repository contains the code for my ECON490 project, which explores crime trends in Vancouver, focusing on potential associations between cannabis legalization in October 2018 and changes in crime patterns. Using historical data, this project applies time-series models to predict crime rates and observe shifts post-legalization.
